## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure the data directory is writable
- Check logs for specific error messages

### Database Issues
- Default SQLite database is created at `data/may.db`
- Ensure the directory exists and is writable
- For schema updates, the app handles migrations automatically

### Notification Issues
- **Email**: Verify SMTP settings and credentials in admin settings
- **ntfy**: Check your topic name is correct
- **Pushover**: Ensure admin has configured the app token
- **Webhook**: Verify the URL is accessible and accepts POST requests

### PDF Generation
- WeasyPrint requires system dependencies on some platforms
- On Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0`
- On macOS: `brew install pango`
