## 📦 Installation

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Create a directory for May
mkdir may && cd may

# Download docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannymcc/may/main/docker-compose.yml

# Start the container
docker compose up -d
```

Or run directly with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name may \
  -p 5050:5050 \
  -v may_data:/app/data \
  -e SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key \
  ghcr.io/dannymcc/may:latest
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:5050`

**First-time login:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: Check your container logs for the auto-generated password

On first run, if no `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable is set, May generates a secure random password and prints it to the console:

```
============================================================
SECURITY NOTICE: Default admin account created
Username: admin
Password: <randomly-generated-password>
Please change this password immediately after first login!
Set ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable to avoid this message.
============================================================
```

To view the password, run:
```bash
docker logs may
```

💡 **Tip:** Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your docker-compose.yml or environment to use a fixed password.

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python run.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Secret key for session encryption
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-random-string

# Database location (default: SQLite)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/may.db

# Upload folder for attachments
UPLOAD_FOLDER=/app/data/uploads
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Session encryption key | Random |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string | `sqlite:///data/may.db` |
| `UPLOAD_FOLDER` | Path for file uploads | `/app/data/uploads` |
| `TAILWIND_ASSET_URL` | Local Tailwind Play CDN JS path | `/static/vendor/tailwindcss.js` |
| `TAILWIND_CDN_URL` | Tailwind CDN fallback URL | `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` |
| `HTMX_CDN_URL` | HTMX CDN URL | `https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10` |

By default, Tailwind loads from `app/static/vendor/tailwindcss.js` and falls back to the CDN URL if the local asset is missing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python / Flask
- **Database**: SQLite (easily swappable)
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS, HTMX, Chart.js
- **Server**: Gunicorn
- **Notifications**: SMTP, ntfy, Pushover, Webhooks
- **PDF Generation**: WeasyPrint

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure the data directory is writable
- Check logs for specific error messages

### Database Issues
- Default SQLite database is created at `data/may.db`
- Ensure the directory exists and is writable
- For schema updates, the app handles migrations automatically

### Notification Issues
- **Email**: Verify SMTP settings and credentials in admin settings
- **ntfy**: Check your topic name is correct
- **Pushover**: Ensure admin has configured the app token
- **Webhook**: Verify the URL is accessible and accepts POST requests

### PDF Generation
- WeasyPrint requires system dependencies on some platforms
- On Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0`
- On macOS: `brew install pango`
